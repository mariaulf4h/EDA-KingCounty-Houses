# First Project - Data Analysis

This project is centered around exploratory data 
analysis [(EDA)](https://github.com/neuefische/datascience-infographics/blob/main/EDA_Checklist.md) techniques and statistical analysis, 
as well as modeling data using linear regression.

## Topic and Task

You will use the [King County Housing Data](data):
This dataset contains information about home sales in King County (USA). 

Your task will be to perform an extensive EDA and to train a explanatory linear regression model. The task is not only to explain the data but also to evaluate how well the model is fitting the data.
For a more detailed task description have a look at the [assignment](Assignment.md).

## Getting Started

Please create a new repository (if you like you can use this [neuefische Repo template](https://github.com/neuefische/ds-eda-project-template). If you create a new repo you can do it with a `Repository template` choose here `ds-project-template`) for this project. Make sure you also create and activate a new virtual environment inside your project repo.
In this environment you can install all the packages you will use during your project using pip. 

```BASH
pyenv local 3.8.5
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
